"""Regression tests for #431: one hung tool call wedged the whole server.

Reported on Windows: ``get_pdf_outline`` never returned, and from then
on *every* other MCP tool timed out with no recovery. Separately, concurrent
tool calls produced "Connection closed" and orphan server processes.

Three mechanisms are covered here, all testable off Windows:

* ``get_pdf_outline`` held the process-global Zotero API lock across the
  outline extraction, so one stuck PDF blocked every other tool behind it.
  The lock now covers the Zotero API work only.
* ``_extract_pdf_toc`` must return within a bounded time on every path, and
  must not hand the server's stdin (the MCP pipe under the stdio transport)
  to a child that can outlive it.
* ``suppress_stdout`` swapped the global ``sys.stdout`` without any
  synchronization, so two concurrent users could leave it pointing at a
  closed devnull.
