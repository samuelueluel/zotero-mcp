"""Every list/dict-typed tool parameter tolerates a stringified value (#459).

Some MCP clients serialize array and object arguments as JSON *text* before
dispatch. Pydantic validates against the published schema before the tool body
runs, so a parameter annotated `list[...]` without `| str` is rejected at the
boundary — and any JSON-parsing the body does for that parameter is dead code
it can never reach.

#459 was the `rect` instance: area annotations were unreachable from Claude
Code entirely. Sweeping for the same shape turned up one more,
`search_items_advanced.conditions`, which was worse — its own description
promised "also accepts a JSON string" and its body had the `json.loads` branch
to honour that, both unreachable.

The sweep is the point of this file. A new list-typed parameter added without
string tolerance fails here rather than in someone's client.
